# Censor
Censorship Application with C++ and SFML for graphics
Idea:
1. Click new button to display a new black window that will always be on top of all other windows
2. Can move black window anywhere on the screen
3. Blocks vision of private information when sharing screen

*This is still a WIP, knowing my record it is never going to be finished
**idk how to use AHK how do I make multiple windows stay on top
***idk how to C++, how to make a vector of RenderWindows
